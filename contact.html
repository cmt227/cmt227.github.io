                <h4 class="textcenter">About Me</h4>
                I grew up in Gainesville, Florida, with my loving family and awesome friends. In high school
                I loved (and still do!) to run, make music, and learn. In 2013 I left home to attend Cornell University
                where I got a degree in Applied and Engineering Physics. I made some great friends there too, making more
                music in my band <a target="_blank" href="https://shull.bandcamp.com">Shull</a> and playing Ultimate Frisbee on the
                <a target="_blank" href="https://www.budsultimate.com/">Cornell Buds</a>. This summer I'm doing a long hike
                in the Olympic Peninsula of Washington state, and then coming back home to find the right thing for me to do next!
                <h4 class="textcenter">What I Believe...</h4>
                I strive for excellence in all I do, and through my actions I hope to make the world
                better than how I found it. I respect all live, human and non-human, and place my relationships
                and resposibilities above my own personal gain. I hope to use my skills and practice my
                passions to help people and places.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm friendly and open-minded, yet confident in my skills and abilities. Knowledge and experience
                guide me, and my desire to positively influence the world drives me. Ingenuity and creativity
                help me produce elegant solutions to the toughest problems, while intuition and common sense keep
                those solutions correct and within realistic limits.
