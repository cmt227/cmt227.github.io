            I love backpacking. I took my first foray into a wild place with my dad when I
               was only 11 years old, and I've been hooked ever since! After a few autumns of short
               trips in the southern Appalachian mountains of Georgia, North Carolina, and Tennessee, 
               I decided to go on my first long backpacking trip right after I graduated high school. 
               I was incredibly fit after my senior-year <a href="#">track season</a>, and ready to 
               head into the high sierra in central California and hike a little over 200 miles on 
               "America's most beautify hike," the John Muir Trail. Check out these photos from my trip!
