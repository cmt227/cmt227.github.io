            <h4 class="textcenter">My Ultralight Thru-hiking Philosophy</h4>
            <p>
                After backpacking a decent amount, I've developed a style and preference for how I like to 
                travel through wild places and what I like to take with me. A lot of this is inspired by
                the ultralight backpacking community: minimize the weight, amount, and complexity of your
                <em>things</em> without compromising safety. But a lot of people tend to think that this means
                sacrificing comfort so you can travel faster and farther. Carrying lighter and less gear definitely
                does allow for this kind of travel, but I've learned that, for me, it makes all kinds of walking 
                just <em>more enjoyable</em>. Even if I only walk 10 miles in a day, I have more fun and my body
                feels better with less stuff. I feel better at camp and can enjoy my surroundings more. I'm "closer
                to nature" because I'm not distracted by the complexity or amount of the human-made things I'm carrying.
                And I have fewer items to forget at camp, or to worry about packing up in the morning. Overall, I've
                found that the ultralight ideals make all of my backcountry excursions more fulfilling and pleasant.
                At the same time, though, I don't spend huge amounts of money just to try to reach some arbitrary 
                maximum base-weight, and I don't fail to bring things that I want or need because it will make my
                pack lighter; instead, I try to want and need fewer things.
