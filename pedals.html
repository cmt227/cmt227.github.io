            During times when I was tired of working on my class D amp, I turned my attention to some smaller
            audio electronics I'd been hoping to build for a while. Here are three guitar effects pedals I built
            over my last semester of school.

            <h4 class="textcenter">PT2399-based Delay Pedal</h4>
            The first high quality pedal I built is this 
            <a target="_blank" href="http://www.valvewizard.co.uk/smalltime.html">delay pedal</a> 
            based on the PT2399 digital delay IC. It was actually tough to fit this circuit into a Hammond 1590bb 
            enclosure, but I was able to make a double sided PCB with the milling machine in the Cornell Maker Lab.
            I think I was the first person to actually make a double sided one on that machine.

            <h4 class="textcenter">Wooly Mammoth Fuzz Clone</h4>
            I built this clone of the Zvex Wooly Mammoth Fuzz pedal. This one was really fun to make because it's
            super simple, there are only nine components! I was able to mount all four of the pots onto the PCB,
            which makes for a super sleek looking finished build. The electronics for this pedal probably cost 
            less than $5, and it's probably less than $20 with the enclosure and foot switches too.
            But Zvex sells them for almost $400! The hand-painted art on his pedals is really cool though, but I 
            also like my raw aluminum finish. :)
