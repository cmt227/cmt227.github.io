	    As a creative guy who loves to have custom, hand-made things, I have longed for a custom painted drum set. I had the idea
	    a long time ago, but only after graduating college have I had the time to make it a reality. For this project I called upon
	    my sister, artist-extraordinaire, to help me create a drum I'd love. Check it out!
        </p>
        <div class="photo-container">
            <div class="col">
                <div class="photo">
                    <img class="photo shadowed" src="img/drum.jpg">
                    <p>
		    	One side of the drum...
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="col">
                <div class="photo">
                    <img class="photo shadowed" src="img/drum2.jpg">
                    <p>
		    	And the other!
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>
		I'm so pleased with the drum now. I painted one side of it, and my sister did the other. It totally fulfills my vision, and
		it's awesome that I have this thing I made with her. It's painted like a cross section of the ocean, and a favorite song lyric
		of mine is painted on: "Loving is the heart when the self loses precedence, and I am just a wave in the sea of relentlessness"
		Because the waves that I painted look a bit more like sea creature fins, I asked my sister to paint on a Yilané, a reptilian
		creature from Harry Harrison's <em>Eden</em> trilogy. I imagine the fins to be those of the Uruketo, the Yilané's ocean-going vessel,
		and the particular Yilané to be the complentative Enge, whom holds the knowledge of the power of life and death. May her voice be
		heard through the thump of my bass drum!!
