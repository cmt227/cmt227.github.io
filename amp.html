            During my senior year at Cornell University, I undertook the ambitious project of
            building a <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class-D_amplifier">class D amplifier</a>
            from scratch. Well, my construction was fully from scratch,
            but my design was based off of the IRS2092 half-bridge driver IC. With the help of
            the chip's documentation and the manufacturer's reference design,
            I was able to apply my prior electronics experience and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.aep.cornell.edu/">
            my engineering education</a> to build a powerful and 
            functional amplifier.

            I wanted to build a class D amplifier partly for the novelty of it, which comes mostly from the fact
            that most people, engineers included, don't even know what <em>class D</em> means. I was also drawn to
            the challenge of building this kind of device, because very few amatuers have done so and there are very
            few examples of class D amps on the web. There are more tangible benefits to this kind of amplifier, which
            stem almost entirely from the increased efficiency of class D operation. These benefits include lower
            heat dissipation, so the output transistors don't require huge heatsinks that cost a lot and take up a lot
            of room. Similarly, in comparison to more typical class A or class AB amplifiers, a smaller power supply 
            can be used to achieve an equivalent power ouput to the speaker load,
            which drastically reduces the weight and cost of parts. There are downsides to a class D amp too. The high 
            switching frequency introduces some hum on the output, and the clipping characteristics are really nasty.
