            <h4 class="textcenter">Overview</h4>
            During my senior year at Cornell University, I undertook the ambitious project of
            building a <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class-D_amplifier">class D amplifier</a>
            from scratch. Well, my construction was fully from scratch,
            but my design was based off of the IRS2092 half-bridge driver IC. With the help of
            the chip's documentation and the manufacturer's reference design,
            I was able to apply my prior electronics experience and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.aep.cornell.edu/">
            my engineering education</a> to build a powerful and 
            functional amplifier.

            I wanted to build a class D amplifier partly for the novelty of it, which comes mostly from the fact
            that most people, engineers included, don't even know what <em>class D</em> means. I was also drawn to
            the challenge of building this kind of device, because very few amatuers have done so and there are very
            few examples of class D amps on the web. There are more tangible benefits to this kind of amplifier, which
            stem almost entirely from the increased efficiency of class D operation. These benefits include lower
            heat dissipation, so the output transistors don't require huge heatsinks that cost a lot and take up a lot
            of room. Similarly, in comparison to more typical class A or class AB amplifiers, a smaller power supply 
            can be used to achieve an equivalent power ouput to the speaker load,
            which drastically reduces the weight and cost of parts. There are downsides to a class D amp too. The high 
            switching frequency introduces some hum on the output, and the clipping characteristics are really nasty.

                        Here is a photo of the completed power amplifier section. The output filter
                        is composed of the large black inductor and blue capacitor on the left. The 16
                        pin IC is the IRS2092 gate driver. The 5 pin TO-92 package on the left is the 
                        half-bridge, and the other TO-92 packages are voltage regulators for the input
                        section and the gate-driver floating power supply.

            I learned a lot while building this device. I'd never worked with power electronics before, so it
            was edifying to construct a rather high voltage power supply (70 volts peak-to-peak in this case),
            and through my readings and the help of my advisor I became confident in my ability to choose parts
            that would work for this application, be safe, and be robust. After destroying a few PCB traces and 
            blowing up a few power resistors due
            to short circuits and other testing mishaps, I became more aware of the power of the device I'd built,
            and also its capabilities and limitations too.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another valuable take away from this project is the confidence I've gained in learning from
            technical documentation. On my first attempt to build the power amp,
            I merely copied the schematic of the reference design, and when I plugged it in I destroyed the
            integrated circuit. I relized that this was a big waste of time and parts because I now had no way
            to find where my error was, nor could I do much to fix it because all my parts were soldered onto
            a PCB. So, I went back to the drawing board and thoroughly read all the documentation of the IRS2092,
            which was great because I ended up learning how every part of the reference schematic worked. I then
            successfully breadboarded the amplifier and ran it off of a lower voltage benchtop power supply before
            soldering the parts to my re-designed PCB.
        </p>
        <p>
            The build also taught me the importance of focusing on attention to detail from the very beginning
            of a big project like this. There were times when I would be stuck on an issue for a few days that turned
            out to be that a part was installed the wrong way!! That is frustrating, but I think I've learned my lesson.
        </p>
        <p>
            Of course, I also learned a lot more about construction through this project. I drilled and milled the 
            aluminum case in Cornell's student machine shop, and I learned a lot about schematic capture and
            PCB design in <a target="_blank" href="http://kicad-pcb.org">KiCad</a>. My soldering skills were practiced
            during many late nights.
