	    This project was really fun for many reasons. It was the first nice thing I made on my printer, and I really like the person
	    I made it for. I ran into some problems when generating the negatives of the lettering, which all started with the fact that
	    the version of FreeCAD I run on my Arch Linux box crashes everytime I try to import an SVG file. The was I went about generating
	    the negatives was to write the text in Inkscape, increase the stoke width, and then export that as an SVG to pocket the front of
	    the cassette case. My work around was to use a web-based 3d modeller, TinkerCAD, into which I could successfully import the SVG.
	    Aside from the slight annoyance of working in multiple modelling programs, this worked pretty well. The text layed into the case
	    made for a really nice color contrast and raised texture that I am quite proud of!
