            <p>I love backpacking. I took my first foray into a wild place with my dad when I
               was only 11 years old, and I've been hooked ever since! After a few autumns of short
               trips in the southern Appalachian mountains of Georgia, North Carolina, and Tennessee, 
               I decided to go on my first long backpacking trip right after I graduated high school. 
               I was incredibly fit after my senior-year <a href="#">track season</a>, and ready to 
               head into the high sierra in central California and hike a little over 200 miles on 
               "America's most beautify hike," the John Muir Trail. Check out these photos from my trip!

                            Here I am at the Happy Isles trailhead, where my dad
                            photographed me prior to my departure. He walked with me up the trail
                            a few miles, but then I was on my own in the backcountry for the first
                            time.

                            This was my last view of Halfdome, seen from atop Cloud's Rest.
                            To the right of Halfdome is Yosemite Valley, where I left my dad the day before.
                            An hour before this picture was taken I came within a meter of a
                            rattlesnake before becoming aware of its presence. Luckily for me, the snake had
                            just caught lunch: a big mouse filled its mouth. That is still the most scary
                            experience I've had in the backcountry.

                            This picture was taken in Lyell Canyon, just a few hours outside of Tuolomne Meadows.
                            My dad is down there taking in the beauty and refilling our water. This was one of
                            our most favorite places along the trail: 5 miles of flat walking through this canyon
                            with wildlife everywhere and an awesome stream for dipping.

                            I jumped off of this rock into the stream about a dozen times.
                            This was really close to Road's End in Sequioa National Park, where I got
                            my last food resupply for the final leg of my hike.

                            Here I am on the top of Mt. Whitney! Although I completed the official JMT route,
                            I still had 13 miles to walk down from the summit to the valley below, which was
                            not easy.

                            I climbed Halfdome on the first morning I woke up in camp. I camped
                            near the base of the Halfdome spur trail, and woke up early to beat
                            the day hikers. This is what the mountain looked like as I approached!
                            I would hate to climb it with people filling that rope ladder, that seems
                            like it would be dangerous and just downright unpleasant. I had a great time
                            roaming the top with only a few other people.

                            The dry mountain air (and maybe the altitude too) gave me a nose bleed
                            in this meadow. It wasn't a big deal though, I controlled the bleeding 
                            with a glove I had and washed up in a nearby stream. How could one be 
                            upset in a meadow like this?! This photo was taken on the 3rd or 4th day 
                            of my trip, just a day or two before I reached Tuolomne Meadows and met up 
                            to hike with my dad for the next week.

                            As we approached the end of Lyell Canyon we looked up at this monster
                            climb to Donahue Pass and the border of Yosemite National Park. We were
                            sad to leave the canyon, but excited to enter the high country.

                            This was my view of the Mt. Whitney Massif as I approached it.
                            I think this photo was taken at Timberline Lake. Later this day
                            I stopped to wait and summit the mountain the following moring at
                            sunrise, but I ended up meeting two awesome guys from San Fransisco
                            and climbing most of the mountain that night. We spent a windy and chilly
                            night high on the mountain, setting up our sleeping bags right in the middle
                            of the trail, and summitted the following morning.
