            <p>
                Three years after my hike in the Sierras, I was ready to hit
                the trail again. I'd visited Colorado for ski trips a couple of times,
                and the Colorado Trail seemed like an awesome hike. It was the perfect
                length for my summer vacation, and the big peaks of the Rockies drew my attention.
                This time I was taking a different approach --
                to go as minimal as I could without breaking the bank. I bought a 
                used backback that was 40L in volume, two thirds the size of the one
                I used in California, and I opted to go with an open tarp setup instead
                of an enclosed tent. I also chose to eat only non-cooked food so I
                didn't have to worry about bringing a stove and getting fuel for it
                during my resupplies. Check out my <a href="#">philosophy and gear</a>
                for more info about what I like to bring with me backpacking, and what 
                inspires those choices. In the mean time, enjoy these photos from the trail!

                            Keller Mountain's Summit View<br/><br/>
                            One of my most favorite places in Colorado was the Eagle's
                            Nest Wilderness. The Colorado Trail doesn't actually pass
                            through this area, but I'd read great things about it and
                            decided to take a few days to explore this place. I walked about
                            25 miles north into the wilderness, and then I took one
                            morning to bushwhack and ridge scramble to the summit of 
                            Keller Mountain, rewarding myself with this view of the Gore Range.

                            Big Climb<br/><br/>
                            This is a photo of the ridge leading up to Casco Peak, one of the 13ers
                            surrounding Half-moon Bay in the shadow of Mt. Elbert. I met this guy along the
                            way, so we decided to climb together. I can't remember his name (maybe it's written
                            in my journal somewhere), but he was really cool. He had a rock climbing accident that
                            left one of his arms pretty attrified, but he was still out here crushing the climbs.
                            We climbed three 13ers that day and then split up.

                            His name was Ping...<br/><br/>
                            This is a photo of my friend Ping and I. I met him on the first night of
                            the hike, and we walked together for about a week. He was such a cool guy,
                            and I'm so glad I got to meet him and walk with him. Eventually I had to go off
                            to complete one of my off-trail segments, and I never saw him again, though for the
                            rest of the trip I hoped and hoped we would cross paths again. I saw his name in the
                            wilderness registers a couple of times, only one or two days ahead of me. Maybe I'll
                            see you on another trail one day, Ping.

                            I really don't remember where this was along the trail, but it sure is
                            a great example of the many wonderful vistas I experienced along the way.

                            I don't take selfies very often, but when I do I'm on top of a massive mountain!!
                            I don't remember where this was, but I'm glad I was there.

                            Elk!<br/><br/>
                            My first off-trail adventure on this hike was along the Kenosha Ridge. 
                            As I rounded the top of a bluff I happened upon this herd of Elk taking a
                            nap in the grass. I was able to pull out my camera and make a noise, snapping
                            the photo right when they were all looking at me but before they galloped
                            away along the ridge line that would take me another few hours to traverse.

                            Me and Elbert<br/><br/>
                            Here's a photo of me with Mt. Elbert in the background. My friend I met in
                            Half-moon Bay took the photo. I'd met another guy who helped me with a
                            ride to the trail the day before who suggested I climb to Elbert's summit
                            via the ridge that ascends straight to the summit and is to the right of me in this 
                            picture. I was pretty excited to try that the next day, but I opted out because
                            it seemed pretty sketchy when I went down there to check it out. It felt good
                            to exercise my restraint, but that climb is something I definitely want to return
                            to with a friend one day.

                            I took this photo from the top of Mt. Massive. The big peak on the left is Mt. Elbert,
                            and the valley in the middle is Half-moon Bay, where I spent the following day climbing
                            some 13ers!
