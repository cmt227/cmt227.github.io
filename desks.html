	    I've built a couple of desks out of wood. Check 'em out!
        </p>

	        I built this desk using 2x4s for the legs, 1x4s for the frame and leg supports, and 3/4 inch MDF for the top. It's really solid!
		The front legs taper in at a slight angle (a little more than 8 degrees measured from the vertical); I like the way this looks.
		I used a chop saw to cut all the angles, including the bevelled edges so the frame looks nice. I cut the top from a 4x8 foot piece
		using a cicular saw! Now I don't have to keep all my electronics on the ground!

	        I was so satisfied with my first desk that I wanted to build a second one at my mom's house! This one is built with identical
		materials, and a very similar asthetic. I even included the slight tapering angle to the outer leg. But instead of being a
		freestanding desk, this one is supported in the back by a scrap piece of MDF that is mounted directly onto the wall. I'm very
		pleased, and hopefully will have more space now to work on my projects!
