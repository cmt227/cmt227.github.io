                One of the first and largest inspirations in my scientific and engineering career was my
                discovery of Linux. The learning curve was steep, as it often is for complicated technical systems,
                but after I got the grasp of it my world was widened. The benefits of Linux have been great for me:
                I have a huge selection of free software to use and learn from, as my command line experience grew so
                did my productivity and intuition for coding, I have a seemingly-infinite playground to creatively 
                develop the computer that <strong>I want to use</strong>, not one that is given to me in some 
                pre-defined, locked state, and I can make a kick-ass computer using old hardware for very little money.
                It's awesome how many times my ten-year-old Linux machine has outperformed Cornell University's
                brand new Windows machines or my friends' $2000 Macbooks.
                After some time, I moved from the Ubuntu distribution to 
                <a target="_blank" href="https://www.archlinux.org">Arch Linux</a>, which has been my platform of choice
                for the last few years. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Linux also opened me up to the larger world of open-source software and hardware, the philosophy of 
                which has really influenced me. I love the idea of sharing knowledge and contributing my efforts
                to projects which benefit many people and are accessible at no cost. I learned about Arduino and physical
                computing through Linux, as well as Raspberry Pi and embedded computing.

                    Linux Shrine<br/>
                    This is my linux shrine, where I worship coding and free software. The hardware here
                    is an Acer CB3-110 Chromebook, onto which I flashed John Lewis's SeaBIOS
                    <a target="_blank" href="https://johnlewis.ie/custom-chromebook-firmware/rom-download/">ROM</a>
                    and installed Arch Linux, with an XMonad-based window manager.

                    Here's a screenshot of my tiling window manger, XMonad. It's written fully in the
                    Haskell programming language, and it's super awesome. These windows show some of the
                    code for this website, which can also be accessed through my
